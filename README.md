![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as
close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.
Both the mobile and desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information such as
color palette and fonts.
